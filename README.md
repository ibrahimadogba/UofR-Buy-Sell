# CS476- U of R buy and Sell

This is a cs476 project.

It is a platform that allows university students to purchase and sell old books online is becoming increasingly necessary. Finding secondhand books may be difficult for students, especially when they're seeking for particular editions or out-of-print titles. Students must also find a way to augment their income by selling their secondhand textbooks.
With the rising cost of Post-secondary education, costs of textbooks follow. It may be difficult for students to browse and locate the books they require within existing online markets since they are not designed to meet their unique demands. For students, the absence of a specific online marketplace for buying and selling old school books might result in increased prices and hassle. A site that is specifically designed for university students' requirements can solve this issue.
